## Key Technical Features

### 1. Multilingual Support (i18n)
```typescript
interface Translation {
  navigation: { home: string; vaccines: string; /* ... */ };
  buttons: { checkSymptoms: string; /* ... */ };
  labels: { enterSymptoms: string; /* ... */ };
  // ... comprehensive translation structure
}
```
- Support for English, Hindi, Odia, and Sambalpuri
- Dynamic content translation including API responses
- Context-aware language switching

### 2. Voice Recognition System
```typescript
const useVoiceRecognition = (options: VoiceRecognitionOptions) => {
  // Real-time speech-to-text with language support
  // Error handling and permission management
  // Auto-stop functionality
}
```
- Multi-language support (Hindi, English, Odia)
- Real-time transcript display
- Error handling for permissions and browser support
- Automatic timeout for better UX

### 3. Medical Diagnosis Algorithm
```typescript
class MedicalDiagnosisEngine {
  diagnose(request: DiagnosisRequest): MedicalDiagnosisResult {
    // Symptom mapping and scoring
    // Location-based disease prevalence
    // Severity assessment
    // Professional help recommendation
  }
}
```

#### Scoring Algorithm:
1. **Base Symptom Matching**: Weight-based scoring for symptom relevance
2. **Diagnostic Criteria**: Primary, secondary, and exclusion criteria
3. **Location-based Scoring**: Endemic, seasonal, and common diseases
4. **Risk Factor Adjustments**: Age, gender, pregnancy, comorbidities
5. **Duration-based Severity**: Illness progression analysis

### 4. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for rural accessibility
- **Offline Capability**: Service worker for basic functionality
- **App-like Experience**: Installable on mobile devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized assets and lazy loading

### 5. Location-based Intelligence
```typescript
const applyStateBasedScoring = (score: number, disease: string, pincode: string) => {
  // Enhanced scoring based on:
  // - Endemic diseases in the region
  // - Seasonal disease patterns
  // - Vector-borne disease risk
  // - Water quality issues
}
```
