### **✅ Confirmed Working Correctly**

The system already has proper confidence-first sorting:

```typescript
return scores.sort((a, b) => {
  // If confidence difference is significant (>2%), prioritize confidence
  if (Math.abs(a.confidence - b.confidence) > 2) {
    return b.confidence - a.confidence; // Higher confidence first
  }
  // If confidence is very close, use score as tiebreaker
  return b.score - a.score;
});
```
